This project implements an interpreter for a simple toy programming language.
The interpreter simulates program execution using an execution stack, symbol table,
output list, and heap, following the principles of interpreters studied in
programming languages courses.

The application is written in **Java** and uses a **layered architecture**:
- Model
- Repository
- Controller
- View

 **How to Run?**
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Make sure Java SDK is configured
3. Run the `Interpreter.java` (or main class)
4. Select and execute a predefined toy program
